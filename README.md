### Loan Delinquency Prediction

Loan default prediction is one of the most critical and crucial problem faced by financial institutions and organizations as it has a noteworthy effect on the profitability of these institutions. In recent years, there is a tremendous increase in the volume of non â€“ performing loans which results in a jeopardizing effect on the growth of these institutions. 
Therefore, to maintain a healthy portfolio, the banks put stringent monitoring and evaluation measures in place to ensure timely repayment of loans by borrowers. Despite these measures, a major proportion of loans become delinquent. Delinquency occurs when a borrower misses a payment against his/her loan.

Given the information like mortgage details, borrowers related details and payment details, our objective is to identify the delinquency status of loans for the next month given the delinquency status for the previous 12 months (in number of months)

### Data Description

train.zip contains train.csv. train.csv contains the training data with details on loan as described in the last section

**Data Dictionary:**
* loan_id	Unique loan ID
* source	Loan origination channel
* financial_institution	Name of the bank
* interest_rate	Loan interest rate
* unpaid_principal_bal	Loan unpaid principal balance
* loan_term	Loan term (in days)
* origination_date	Loan origination date (YYYY-MM-DD)
* first_payment_date	First instalment payment date
* loan_to_value	Loan to value ratio
* number_of_borrowers	Number of borrowers

* m1 to m12	Month-wise loan performance (deliquency in months)
* m13	target, loan deliquency status (0 = non deliquent, 1 = deliquent)

##### test.zip
test.zip contains test.csv which has details of all loans for which the participants are to submit the delinquency status - 0/1 (not probability)

##### sample_submission.zip
sample_submission.zip contains the submission format for the predictions against the test set. A single csv needs to be submitted as a solution.

##### Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated on F1-Score between the predicted class and the observed target.

### Approach 

I first visualized the dataset to check if there is any correlation between any columns. Then I plotted various columns to check the behaviour of the dataset. After plotting the graphs, I used **LabelEncoder** to encode the categorical variables. Then I used **Feature Scaling** to rescale the dataset. Then I used **XGBoost Classifier** to train the dataset. I also used GridSearch to select best parameters of the model. 



### How to use

Install the dependencies and libraries to get started.

$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Start the Jupyter Server to access the notebook.
```sh
$ jupyter notebook
```
Or run the Python3 file.
```sh
$ python3 ml_hiring_hackathon.py
```
